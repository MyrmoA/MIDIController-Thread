# Arduino Threaded Environment for MIDI Controller

![MIDI Controller](../MyrmoA/Thread/blob/master/finalproduct.jpg)

This Library was built to handle a threaded environment that can manage multiple tasks for an Arduino microprocessor. It utilizes timer interrupts to keep small tasks running while focusing on the main funtionality. 

Used to upload an Arduino sketch to an Arduino/Multiplexer to read potentiometers on a MIDI controller.



The Threaded Arduino Environment was developed for a Project for the Cyper Physical Systems course at Florida Gulf Coast University.
